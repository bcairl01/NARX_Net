A N\-A\-R\-X Network library for C/\-C++ which utilizes F\-A\-N\-N

\section*{Description}

This library is a C/\-C++ implementation of the recurrent N\-A\-R\-X neural network for time series predicition and nonlinear system characterization. The network is trained via an intcremental B\-P\-T\-T rotuine with configuratbale learning rate adaptions, making it suitable for use with on-\/line learning tasks. The implementation utilizes the \char`\"{}\-F\-A\-N\-N\char`\"{} C-\/libraries for the network's base feed-\/forward components, which have been included in this repo

Networks can be configured for use in both parallel and series-\/parallel mode, which can be switched on the fly.
