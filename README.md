# NARX_Net
A NARX Network library for C/C++ which utilizes FANN


# Description
This library is a C/C++ implementation of the recurrent NARX neural
network for time series predicition and nonlinear system characterization. The network is trained via an intcremental BPTT rotuine with configuratbale learning rate adaptions, making it suitable for use with on-line learning tasks. The implementation utilizes the "FANN" C-libraries for the network's base feed-forward components, which have been included in this repo

Networks can be configured for use in both parallel and series-parallel mode, which can be switched on the fly.
